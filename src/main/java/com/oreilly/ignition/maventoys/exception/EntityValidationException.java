/**
 * Exception thrown when validation on an entity fails. This class is used
 * across the application to signal validation errors that occur during
 * the creation or update of entities.
 *
 * <p>This exception is often thrown in service where
 * input data for entities are validated against specific business rules
 * or constraints. It extends {@link RuntimeException} to allow for unchecked
 * exception handling, facilitating a cleaner codebase by not requiring
 * methods to explicitly catch or declare it, thus allowing higher-level
 * handlers to manage the exception.</p>
 *
 * <p>The message associated with the exception should provide a detailed
 * explanation of the validation failure to aid in debugging and user
 * feedback.</p>
